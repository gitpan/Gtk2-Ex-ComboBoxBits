=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text -- text combobox with "active-text" property

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text;
 my $combo = Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text->new_text;
 $combo->append_text ('First Choice');
 $combo->append_text ('Second Choice');

 $combo->set (active_text => 'Second Choice');

=head1 WIDGET HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text> is a subclass of
C<Gtk2::ComboBox>,

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::Container
        Gtk2::Bin
          Gtk2::ComboBox
            Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a "text" style convenience C<Gtk2::ComboBox> with the addition of an
C<active-text> property, and a couple of pseudo-properties to help filling
in the choices.

The C<active-text> property is the same as C<< $combo->get_active_text >>
but as a property can be treated a bit more generally than a method call,
for instance link it up to another widget with
C<Glib::Ex::ConnectProperties>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $combobox = Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text->new (key => value,...) >>

=item C<< $combobox = Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text->new_text (key => value,...) >>

Create and return a new Text combobox object.  C<new> and C<new_text> are
the same thing, since a Text combobox is always text style.  Optional
key/value pairs set initial properties per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.

    my $combo = Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text->new;

=item C<< $combobox->set_active_text ($str) >>

The choice C<$str> active, the same as setting the C<active-text> property.

It's slightly unspecified as yet what happens if C<$str> is not available as
a choice in C<$combobox>.

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<active-text> (string or C<undef>, default C<undef>)

The text of the selected item, or C<undef> if nothing selected.

=item C<append-text> (string, write-only)

=item C<prepend-text> (string, write-only)

Write-only pseudo-properties which add text choices to the combobox as per
the usual C<append_text> and C<prepend_text> methods.

=back

=head1 BUILDABLE

C<Gtk2::Ex::ComboBox::Text> inherits the usual buildable support from
C<Gtk2::ComboBox>, allowing C<Gtk2::Builder> (new in Gtk 2.12) to construct
a Text combobox.  The class name is C<Gtk2__Ex__ComboBox__Text> and
properties and signal handlers can be set in the usual way.

The C<append-text> property is a good way to add choices to the combobox
from within the builder specification.  Either C<active> or C<active-text>
can set an initial selection.  Here's a sample fragment, or see
F<examples/text-builder.pl> in the ComboBoxBits sources for a complete
program.

    <object class="Gtk2__Ex__ComboBox__Text" id="combo">
      <property name="append-text">First Choice</property>
      <property name="append-text">Second Choice</property>
      <property name="active">0</property>
    </object>
